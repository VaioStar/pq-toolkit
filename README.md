# WIMU 24Z

# Features

* New tab for the administrator
  displaying test statistics in the form of charts, allowing
  the administrator to view, for example, the average scores, number of ratings, or
  the frequency of each rating.
* Ability to save the above-mentioned statistics as a PDF file and download it to the local computer in the form of a report.
* Ability to add new samples to the system without conducting tests. Currently, there is no option to populate
  the application with example samples.
* A new tab listing all samples in the system with the ability to rate them on a scale of 1-10 and
  rank the best and worst-rated samples.
* Playback of samples before starting a test. Currently, after adding a new sample,
  it cannot be listened to before running the test. Thanks to this new feature, users
  will be able to ensure they uploaded the correct sample.
* A new tab with a system manual for the administrator, which will clearly
  guide a new administrator step by step through the entire process of using the application.
* Introduction of CI/CD practices to the project, enabling automation and improvement of the development,
  testing, and deployment processes, as well as integration with MkDocs documentation generation.
* Refreshing the existing project documentation generated by MkDocs along with the addition of automatic
  documentation updates when the application is redeployed. Additionally, automatic documentation launch
  upon application startup, currently to view the documentation generated by MkDocs, it must be started via the terminal.
